# Music Share App

This is a simple music sharing application built for practicing Material UI and Emotion styling. The application itself has minimal functionality. Therefore, the main purpose of this application is for practicing UI/UX design

## NOTE:

As of React v.18, integrating parts of material ui have changed... particularly the usage of ThemeProvider, makeStyles, etc...

Currently, in order to make use of the "@mui/styles" library, one may have to include '--force' in their installation command due to npm throwing dependency errors.
